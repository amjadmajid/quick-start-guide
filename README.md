# Quick Start

## Documentation

The most up-to-date documentation about the project, the overall architecture, and the current implementation of the components is available in the [Docs](https://github.com/fluidos-project/Docs) repository.

## Software components
Currently available components:

- FLUIDOS node: a component that can consist of either a single device or a set of devices, primarily serving as a representation of a Kubernetes node. It is managed by a singular Kubernetes Control Plane. For additional information, kindly consult the [FLUIDOS node repository](https://github.com/fluidos-project/node)
- FLUIDOS at the edge: a minimal architecture for running the FLUIDOS components at the edge of the network on some STM boards, leveraging KubeEdge.

## Click-and-play playground
This section summarizes the basic steps to reach a minimal setup of the available FLUIDOS components.

- FLUIDOS node: Explore the FLUIDOS node with our step-by-step guide to effortlessly set up a FLUIDOS Node testbed using KIND (Kubernetes in Docker), which represents the simplest method to install this software on your local machine.
